### About me

Working with texts as a copywriter, I became interested in marketing and product management and went from a regular author to Сhief Product Editor in two years. Сurrently I research and improve user experience as a product manager. 

Regular interaction with dev-team has advanced my ineterest in frontend and backend development so I've started learn Javascript myself. My goal is to master dev tools to beсcome capable to create whatever I want without any limitations and to help other people and projects make out world better.
